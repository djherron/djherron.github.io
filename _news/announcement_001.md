A research proposal paper I submitted to the Doctoral Consortium of ISWC (International Semantic Web Conference) 2022 has been accepted for presentation at the conference in October, in Hangzhou, China. :wine_glass:

Due to China's zero Covid-19 policy, the ISWC conference this year is virtual, so I'm not obliged to incur the cost of travelling to China to deliver the presentation, which is a huge financial bonus. But going there would have been a huge adventure. :slightly_smiling_face: :confused: :neutral_face: (ambivalence)
