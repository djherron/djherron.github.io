As part of attending [ISWC 2022](https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/) (virtually, 23-27 October), I attended the [Doctoral Consortium](https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/index.php/doctoral-consortium-2/) on 24 October, during which I presented my research proposal paper **Visual Relationship Detection using Knowledge Graphs for Neural-Symbolic AI**.

First conference presentation!  Went well.  :tada:
