The inaugural meeting of a newly-conceived academic AI research community focused around the unifying theme of Neuro-Symbolic AI took place yesterday, 28 October,  2022, on the campus of City, University of London, amongst a small group of like-minded, City-based academics in the Computer Science department, together with some of their former/current PhD students.  The tentative name for this nascent group is the Neuro-Symbolic Systems community.  The vision is for the community to be and remain City-based but be borderless (in terms of departments, institutions, countries), so that academics/researchers based anywhere whose research interests (in some way) intersect with (or are covered by) the umbrella-like theme of Neuro-Symbolic AI, will be and feel welcome.

Current priorities with respect to getting the community established include:
* conceiving/creating a logo to express an identity for the community;
* investigating/planning establishment of a (static site) Web presence, most likely using GitHub Pages and, hence, likely, the static site generator Jekyll. The vision is for the community's Web presence to ultimately be managed and maintained using a decentralised model, where community members share site maintenance privileges and responsibilities.
