After a long wait, our paper entitled **On the Potential of Logic and Reasoning in Neurosymbolic Systems Using OWL-Based Knowledge Graphs** has (finally) been published in the new journal [Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/nai). :tada:

The paper was first written and submitted to the nascent **NAI** journal in 2023.  After a couple of rounds of revision, the paper was accepted for publication in 2024. Then things went quiet for many more months due to the original publisher, **IOS Press**, having been taken over by another publisher, **Sage**. Once the transaction was complete and **Sage** had absorbed the new journal into its systems, a further round of paper reviewing and proofing ensued in order to get the paper ready for publication by **Sage**.

You can access the paper from my publications page.
