I'm a PhD student of Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on **visual relationship detection** within images using hybrid, **neurosymbolic systems** where the symbolic components are **semantic web knowledge graphs** and **OWL ontologies**.

The macro context of my research involves blending the **neural** (connectionist) and **symbolic** traditions of AI that, throughout most of AI's history, have operated as tribal academic silos. The idea is to explore ways of combining **deep learning** (neural networks) with **symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning** (in the form of OWL ontologies, knowledge graphs and rules) in order to get the best of both worlds and demonstrate that **hybrid, neural-symbolic AI** systems can **outperform** AI systems that rely on **neural AI** (statistical, inductive, deep learning) alone.  An underlying motivation is to help show that **semantic web technologies, ontologies and knowledge graphs** are cool and can make valuable contributions to AI.
