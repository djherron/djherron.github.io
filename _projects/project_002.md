# Introduction

This page lists candidate **Jekyll themes** for building & maintaining the  anticipated public website of the nascent **Neuro-Symbolic Systems** AI research community that is emerging within the Computer Science department at City, University of London.  The anticipated website would become the public face of the City-rooted but, ultimately, global research community and be used to structure, communicate and promote its activities.

It also lists some **Jekyll themes** I've become aware of for building personal websites used by academics.

# Candidate community website themes

This section lists some Jekyll themes I've come across that appear to be candidates for a website for the Neuro-Symbolic Systems research community.

### al-folio

As mentioned below, in the section on *Personal website Jekyll themes*, the **al-folio** theme was originally conceived for personal websites for academics. It's the theme used by the site you're currently visiting!  But as I get to know this theme better, it's becoming clear that it's also feature-rich enough and flexible enough to support websites for academically-oriented groups.  Hence, I now regard it as a strong candidate Jekyll theme for the Neuro-Symbolic Systems group.

Evidence for this opinion can be found in the **User community** section of the **README.md** page of the **al-folio** repo. There is a table there where people/groups who have used the theme and have come to admire it provide links to their sites. You'll see that the **al-folio** theme has been used by several academic Lab Groups, several academic course modules at CMU (Carnegie Mellon Univ), and by several AI conferences & workshops (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ...).  Visiting and browsing a sample of these sites gives one a sense of the features and flexibility of the theme and helps build confidence that it will be a *safe investment* for the Neuro-Symbolic Systems group.

Another source of confidence in the **al-folio** Jekyll theme is the number of times this repo has been forked: over 6,400!  Not bad.

Yet another source of confidence is how active is its community.  Loads of people submit Issues (for the occasional bug but also for feature requests); loads of people contribute by submitting Pull Requests; the Discussions page is full and current; and my *fork* of the repo was already 8 commits behind the main repo after about 1 week.

A further reason for having confidence in this theme is that, although it does not advertise the fact, the sites it produces are indeed **mobile-friendly**!  Check some of the **User community** sites (or the one you're visiting) on your phone and see.
